OVERVIEW

This is an MXJ object which launches an embedded web server. It uses
the pure Java web server Jetty (http://www.mortbay.org/). We support
interaction with the Max world: Max is informed of URL information
from web browsers, and can inject attributes back into JSPs.

We have included the necessary Jetty JAR files, and other
utilities such as log4j, in this distribution.

INSTALLATION

Copy the JAR files to the Cycling '74/java/lib directory (or modify
max.java.config.txt to search in the appropriate directory). Be sure
to remove old or obsolete versions.

Copy the files in the examples/ folder into Max's search path.

ISSUES

When Jetty starts up, it logs to the standard error stream, rather than
standard output, so some error messages appear in the Max console. This
behaviour appears to be benign.

We've added support for request parameters, to allow data to be passed
between the web world and Max. There's no guarantee that a "round trip"
request (from a browser URL into Max and back via a JSP) will work
atomically, especially since Jetty will be multithreading requests from
(potentially) multiple clients, so the linkage should be regarded as
somewhat decoupled, to say the least. At some stage we might think about
tagging each request to allow Max to deal with contextual data from
multiple simultaneous clients (would that be polyphonic?).

JSP compilation requires Apache Ant; Jetty comes bundled with Ant 1.6.5,
which is somewhat behind the current release (1.7.0 at the time of
writing). Hopefully this won't confuse any software (or users); if it
does, I'll have a bash with 1.7.0.
