This is a growing repository of MAX MSP patches.  It is going to take serious work organizing and putting this in cohesive order. ALPHA
I hope to encourage open-source collaboration, so contributions are welcome!
Alot of these patches are disorganized, from public forums, undocumented, etc, etc.

This is bound to change once I've got some time to sift through the material and determine what's what. It is likely that the majority of this code will become open-source
