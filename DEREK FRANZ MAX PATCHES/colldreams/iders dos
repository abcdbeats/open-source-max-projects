The characters of the language have both a words meaning(logographs) as well as a ponetic meaning thus froming a word from the stringng together of syllables,  this dual state of meaning confused the early translators of the 20th century becasue most west schools of thought used to the simple geometry of the alpha bet didn't concive that the flowing graphical intricacies of the mayan script could be anything more elaborate that artistic renderings of icons.  THe early translation of the mayan alpha bet by delamda had reinforced the confusion as a romantic language scaffolding was applied the mayan language system,  the attempt to quantify the mayan script into the letter logic of the romatic language manifested the confusion as theri was no direct parrellel for our alphaet the mayans didn't compartmentalize their language into letter but were content with the atom being the syllable,  As linguist percieved a flaw in the letter phonetic translation they flipped to the camp of iconography only in 1950s did russian n linguaist Yuri knorozov return to the lanugage unbias by more western quantification and started translating the dresden codex according to phonetic syllable atoms.  further Proskouriakoff perceived certain periodic cycles in hte stone monumentis analyses and with numbers being the first body of translated information the periiodic pattern was exposed of the life and death of leaders,  the ruler glyph Bonampak muralsprojects sprite archive,  expounder optimizing3d rotation ascent for tile forms and body formssync orth plane and character plane in 3denergy workshop develop math algorythems for exfoliation cycles of deplomentasociative net for my journals topology of the word relationingsend words mixes out into the net to find pictureskeep track of website names to form topology picture anayis per vector graphic reverse enginehttp://www.forums.bobandgeorge.com is the central nervous systemhttp://www.odinsrealm.com/tatakau/     http://www.videogamesprites.nethttp://sprites.fireball20xl.com/http://www.vgmaps.com/http://www.rpgpics.com/http://deekman.aftervision.com/http://www.fated-circle.com/http://www.gsarchives.net/http://www.panelmonkey.orghttp://www.retrogamezone.co.uk/http://www.nes-snes-sprites.com/http://tsgk.captainn.net/http://www.bghq.com Nintendo president Satoru Iwata revealed that the machine can download game data wirelessly, then play it back. Game Sharing  "The DS's wireless connection isn't just a substitute for the link cable that was used on the Game Boy for multiplayer games. The DS has wireless download capability, which allows it to receive a program and to execute it. With it, people can play games together using only one cartridge," commented Iwata, citing as one example Super Mario 64 DS' four-player, one-cartridge simultaneous gameplay. Go To (Japanese) Movies And Get Pokémon and Maps Beamed To Your DS  "On a related subject, we're planning to try integrating the DS with movie theaters. By using the system's wireless functionality, users that bring their DS and GBA Pokémon cartridge to designated theaters will be able to download game data that will be distributed during certain scenes of next summer's Pokémon movie. In one scene where the main characters meet a new Pokémon, that character's data will be sent to their cartridges. This will be the first time such a distribution scheme has been used anywhere in the world."accept and go to conflictSent in by DerekGorsia takes you into his dark underworld or whatever, like the land of the dead.

The collision map was a bitmap w/ 8 bits depth. Each sprite had a 1-bit collision map, so I didn't have to worry about transparency and all that. The sprites were numbered from 1 to 255, so I could handle only 255 sprites.For each bit in the collision bitmap of a sprite, I wrote the sprite-number into the collision map, so I would know which sprite collided with which (or which one was hit by a bullet). You could increase the number of sprites by increasing the bit-depth of the collision map.After handling all the sprites, I started projecting the bullet's trails (collision trails) through the collision map using Bresenham's algorithm as stated above by fl0yd. I treated bullets as vectors with a length according to their speed. If a bullet moved 10 pixels/frame, it's collision trail would simply have a length of 10 pixels. The collision trails were drawn in xor-mode with a 0-value, so I could detect which sprite was hit.When you've detected a collision in the collision map, you would render an explosion or whatever instead of the actual sprite in the display map.tell application "System Events"   tell process "Tetris"     keystroke "1"   end tell end tell different layers moving in ratios to verify different dephtmask overstate connected to drawing commandthe masks can be low resolution, fade effects recursive inclusion fade corner then run the elements in the mix "mapwarrior"floatingpoints are used for precision smallificationthere slessresolutionon theright themoreyou are expanding,andcontrarywise the is less resolution to theleftwhen diminuatingpress abuttontosolidify the depth axis duringcreationibelievein littlethingsjustlikemehowlittlethings can belike tiny bubbles andspider webs and starfish in the seajit.bsortlighttodark remapeqivalency gl intuitivercolorpaletes permaplandmidito reasonspunkingpython scripting Blender downloaded tutorial on the game engine.wantedto ladderedomain effectrons andgivethemimpulse beams of fractal for semeningme pageblink arcperception desertshrubgrassstonewallstoneroofwaterred brickapplescriptwarpthe makemap patch fills a matrix with a spatial mapping of cartesian to polar coordinatesawesomebitchars- 1pics babiesmax new mspspriteliblegacypictures of prisms for landscape antimovementmultinodetree hoverbrainala mageslayer drivyfinmusic in my head listradarlove 3pm 6 19 04midi interface g4 t g3scripting interfaceforplanetconstructionscriptvariablesofany kind or only certain?notonlyyoshiisland animated at vgmaps.comnew accountebay  rouing 121 042 882backwards music is sounding really german today Some read from addresses that are not specified  in the NSF specifications, expecting certain values to be returned.

John  Hall creates a perfect child. The boy is made out of bone china, which  is a symbol of the immencely fagile nature a perfect child would have  to have. The emphasis is on the childs destruction at the hands of  peers in school. The kids are always trying to break him. Bone china  boy is very very vulnerable. He is a prototype for a feminine male. A male with openly feminine qualities is certain to be destroyed in  lower school, if not in all social interactions. This constant  destruction leads the boy to assume Hall to have created him out of  hate and hostility. How else could someone have created such an  incompatable child, except for on purpose to find pleasure in the pain  and alienation bone china boy feels? Bone china boy cannot understand  that he is perfect if he cannot function within the society. That is  also why Hall wants to but bone china back on the mantle. ãBe careful  of philosiphers for they mistake the ideal for reality.ä Hall wants to  return the child to the ideal for he realizes the incompatability of  perfection with reality. ãIâll make you a deal bone china boy. You  leave me alone and I wonât throw you out the window.ä John himself is  flawed, as all humans, thus he realizes that even he cannot converse  with his own son. His only option is to alienate the bone china  because it is impossible to deal with him. Another stunt aspect of the  bone china boy is that if he were to take any damage, a wild pitch, or  a hammer taken to him, he no longer would be a bone china boy just a  bunch of broken peices of bone china. I think this bunch of broken  pieces of bone china is Hallâs symbol for a normal human. For what are  we but broken perfection attempting to put ourselves together but once  we get there, which we won't, we realize there is not point because we  cannot co-exist with irregulars. "I'll just kill myself in that corner"  Oil points to corner. Just the jist of one of his recent songs. Up my ass. THis title  refers to the accumulation of knowledge and it's dispersal. Emphasis is given at the end upon the freeness to which entrance to children of his  ass is given as is the basic assuption of immortality and acceptance  through passing on knowledge to the next generation. Hall also speaks  of not being one of those guys who pretends his shit doesn't stink, his  shit stinks and he is one to admit it. I belive this to refer to hall  not being one of those faggots that goes to hang out at starbucks to act  intellectual. These people that retain their philosophies and  intellectual comprehension if they even exis, from expresion of  conversement because they want some kind of status for intellectual  aloofness. Halls knowledge is in public domain if anyone asks for it  thus it stinks from public existence. This is in no way a bad stink but  only emphasis on it's presence is attempted. He will accept all  knowledge for considering and refinement except for the skanky plastic  ideas of these psudeo intellectuals that do it for status. This useless  knowledge can stay within the ass of the original retainer.Schedule DO NOT EXPAND ARCHIVES WITH STUFFIT EXPANDER!! If downloaded file placed on your Desktop, open "Terminal" application and enter, cd ~/Desktop/ tar -zxf FlareStorm.tar.gz If your browser automatically expand gzip compression, you will get .tar file. then, enter  tar -xf FlareStorm.tar  09:00a  06:05p  9h, 5m  1  GLI  6725 11:20a  08:45p  9h, 25m  1  GLI  6703 03:20p  12:30a  9h, 10m  1  GLI  6707 09:05p  The Salesman: Hey, bud. Ernie: Who me? The Salesman: SHHHHHH! Ernie: (whispering) Who me? The Salesman: Riiiiiiiight! (sung) How would you like to buy an "O"? Round and neat A nearly perfect circle Tidy and complete You can sing a pretty song With it like so: O!
