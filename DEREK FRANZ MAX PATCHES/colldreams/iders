Eunoia, characterized by aspirated vowels and clipped, purring consonants, is a language of dual meanings. Depending on how a word is pronounced, it can be a greeting or a veiled threat, reflecting the alien Taelon philosophy. Because the Taelons are genderless and think as a group, their language doesn't include words for "he" and "she" and uses the plural forms of words as their standard form. Eunoia also doesn't reflect tense, as in past, present, or future, because the Taelons do not consider moments in time to be separate. Eunoia is written in three dimensions and reading it is a matter not only of translation, but also of emotional insight and empathy. DOWN SAMPLE AND TRAIN BACKWARDS FORWARDS BLOCK GESTURES AND RATIO LIKELY HOOD COMPARISON BASED ON BEST xOFFSET worst y offset chain like worm living on the mountainand connectivesare transferable If they were not Then the culture is wrong Culture is a framework to develop consicousness Mystical is no framework after developed consicousness (disordering the order accordingly) It might be mystical before the conscoisuness is developed but that is not a question that can be answered through 1 of 2 thus not my both Sciecne cannot explain that which is out of the framework Nothing acan That is the silence Access but no description An individual access in a way because it is incomunicable A excessively shared access in a way because once the expreicen that is indescribleable is had It is shared with another without any action or expression necessary Kinship Is attained perhaps never in the symbols But in the connotation the passion the method the silencewater drip trip drop slip relflect tectonic subsonicninja turtless stealth tour money for possesions and travel yummy food poor almish kid with no structure too much structure attach to the school in the fall to retain a degree attach lead to relate seethrough structure future bleief ofk return to sentiment the astral projection to the video drome graphic center out locustion make the tape all peices music for some new piece need s a vocal track for the ratain structure make video and attach at future point need a vga to phono transistor for future belief paterns mov or final ctu to outport dvdplayer and burner percussion final center tube a notion of fame nad fortune the clock says the middle of the night its probably right necessary act4ions thruhg retrograde formulation trael this summer with j and myself anadd the religious syystem of music shelterf orest goodness elecronic halycon and see if anyone attaches to the notion if you dont in stead of getting stronng noises you get first nasty dull noises liike this two little boys homosexual heterosexual attach to a woman become a woman become a man a strong centerpiece failure of flaw suicide structure go up the ocast and sell and knit and paint nad find the future and hand out the tape and do one more peice on tape this peice iwll have voal repetroire two tapes for elsea two cds make them tomorrow slelep a little before the vocal track fo representiaton to go with the channeling video focus make powerI am now inside a container of subroutine speed of subrotine s interesting to the from to hte back the machine starts and stops informaton daa flow through the web rlation and consider s hthe attachments to the binder system rendered 3 dim understandin fromts to the cicumscirbed relation for the fact as to way and til on o still onuen a nother fact start again dae to way repeat tell research to as feel hone to way tway way way one to on to as to fact to stell as swet and feel and form and all front andsnd time before relaease and steal and fact and watsonvill 27 at 154 cream master 4 coloredvideogame enusal distrubing movie negative uzis ypuknowI;listops check out lyon oscil~ adapter rma- 10417 mce 30 hughes suite 203 irvine 92618 904646208 invoice 236428 date 2 9 4mountain strides besides floating curcutiofdata rememberance what is the net of that picture the avatar must manifest pictures floating symetries buzzing enculminationof envelops exagerated of the polar stream tofind pictures ofallthearchetypes collect pictures and automate the seems a kalidescope sky streamabove thousands of pictures floating in the ethos faucet resistor fluoxorlove them john kale velvet underground dRejim plank a girl from camarillo ksitruc lhateucsc freeserials.com dreamweaver Serial: WPD700-59307-57794-25353word lenghtrepeat I.
