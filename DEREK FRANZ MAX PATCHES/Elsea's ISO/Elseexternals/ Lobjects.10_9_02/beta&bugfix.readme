What's in the Beta folder?10/21/02Lswap-- modified to deal better with lists of symbols.10/8/02  Everything was rolled into the main bundle, exceptLlife-- This is my cellular automata package. Runs in a graphic window, soon to be replaced with a a jit version.  scale -- this was written for karlheiz Essl's Real Time Compositon Library. The first version has a bug, which was fixed, but it's still floating around. If you aren't using the RTC, I'd suggest Lscale.the jimmies scale is something different.Lsymcat -- when msp was released, folks wanted to to specify file paths and it turned out to be very difficult because they are one long symbol. this concatenates symbols. Absolute path and relative path have made this obsolete.watch this space for new items-- coming soon, UI objects.
